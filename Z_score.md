## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical specification for implementing Z-score statistical analysis within the modular exchange system's funding rate dashboard. The system currently tracks 1,240 perpetual futures contracts across 600+ unique cryptocurrency assets from four exchanges: Binance (547 contracts), KuCoin (477 contracts), Hyperliquid (171 contracts), and Backpack (43 contracts). The Z-score implementation will enhance the existing real-time funding rate monitoring system by providing pure statistical analysis of historical funding rate patterns for informational purposes.

## Statistical Foundation and Methodology

### Z-Score Definition and Application

The Z-score is a standardized statistical measure that quantifies the number of standard deviations a data point deviates from its historical mean. In funding rate analysis, this metric provides an objective measure of how unusual or extreme a current funding rate is relative to its recent historical behavior.

**Mathematical Formula:**

```
Z-Score = (Current Funding Rate - Historical Mean) / Historical Standard Deviation

```

Where:

- **Current Funding Rate**: The most recent funding rate value from the exchange
- **Historical Mean**: Average funding rate over the lookback period
- **Historical Standard Deviation**: Measure of funding rate volatility over the lookback period

### Statistical Interpretation Framework

The Z-score interpretation follows the properties of the standard normal distribution, though funding rates may not always exhibit perfect normality:

| Z-Score Range | Statistical Significance | Statistical Interpretation | Theoretical Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < -3.0 | Extreme Negative (3+ σ) | Value is more than 3 standard deviations below mean | 0.15% of observations |
| -3.0 to -2.0 | Very High Negative (2-3 σ) | Value is 2-3 standard deviations below mean | 2.35% of observations |
| -2.0 to -1.0 | Moderate Negative (1-2 σ) | Value is 1-2 standard deviations below mean | 13.5% of observations |
| -1.0 to +1.0 | Normal Range (within 1 σ) | Value is within 1 standard deviation of mean | 68% of observations |
| +1.0 to +2.0 | Moderate Positive (1-2 σ) | Value is 1-2 standard deviations above mean | 13.5% of observations |
| +2.0 to +3.0 | Very High Positive (2-3 σ) | Value is 2-3 standard deviations above mean | 2.35% of observations |
| > +3.0 | Extreme Positive (3+ σ) | Value is more than 3 standard deviations above mean | 0.15% of observations |

## System Architecture and Data Flow

### Current System Infrastructure

The existing system operates on a 30-second update cycle with sequential data collection to manage API rate limits. The Z-score calculation will integrate into this pipeline without disrupting the current flow:

```
Current Data Flow:
1. Sequential Exchange Collection (staggered by 30-120-180 second delays)
2. Data Normalization (BaseExchange pattern)
3. PostgreSQL Storage (exchange_data and funding_rates_historical tables)
4. FastAPI Backend Processing
5. React Dashboard Display

```

### Enhanced Data Flow with Z-Score Integration

```
Enhanced Data Flow:
1. Existing Collection Pipeline (unchanged)
2. Statistical Calculation Layer (NEW)
   - Retrieve historical data from funding_rates_historical
   - Calculate rolling statistics per contract
   - Compute Z-scores for current values
3. Statistical Storage (NEW: funding_statistics table)
4. API Enhancement (modified endpoints)
5. Dashboard Visualization (enhanced components)

```

## Exchange-Specific Data Characteristics

### Actual Funding Interval Distribution

Based on the current system's real data, funding intervals vary significantly both between and within exchanges:

### Binance (547 contracts total)

| Market Type | Funding Interval | Contract Count | Percentage | Data Points/Day | 30-Day Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USD-M | 4 hours | 337 | 61.6% | 6 | 180 |
| USD-M | 8 hours | 208 | 38.0% | 3 | 90 |
| USD-M | 1 hour | 2 | 0.4% | 24 | 720 |
| COIN-M | 8 hours | 36 | 100% (of COIN-M) | 3 | 90 |

**Key Characteristics:**

- Majority of contracts (61.6%) operate on 4-hour intervals
- USD-M perpetuals dominate with 511 contracts
- COIN-M contracts exclusively use 8-hour intervals
- Mixed interval structure requires contract-specific calculations

### KuCoin (477 contracts total)

| Funding Interval | Contract Count | Percentage | Notable Contracts | Data Points/Day | 30-Day Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 hours | 283 | 59.3% | Most major pairs | 6 | 180 |
| 8 hours | 189 | 39.6% | Standard perpetuals | 3 | 90 |
| 1 hour | 5 | 1.0% | API3USDTM, CARVUSDTM, DUCKUSDTM, MYXUSDTM, XEMUSDTM | 24 | 720 |

**Key Characteristics:**

- Similar distribution to Binance with 4-hour dominance
- Five special contracts with 1-hour intervals (API3USDTM, CARVUSDTM, DUCKUSDTM, MYXUSDTM, XEMUSDTM)
- XBT notation for Bitcoin contracts (normalized to BTC)
- All contracts have fixed, predictable funding intervals
- No variable intervals found in current data (all contracts have fixed intervals)

### Hyperliquid (171 contracts total)

| Funding Interval | Contract Count | Percentage | Characteristics | Data Points/Day | 30-Day Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 hour | 171 | 100% | All contracts | 24 | 720 |

**Key Characteristics:**

- Uniform 1-hour intervals across all contracts
- Highest data frequency among all exchanges
- DEX architecture with on-chain settlement
- Most data points for statistical calculations (720 per 30 days)

### Backpack (43 contracts total)

| Funding Interval | Contract Count | Percentage | Characteristics | Data Points/Day | 30-Day Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 hour | 43 | 100% | All contracts | 24 | 720 |

**Key Characteristics:**

- Recently standardized to 1-hour intervals
- Newest exchange with potentially limited historical data
- USDC-margined contracts
- High frequency data collection like Hyperliquid

### Data Point Availability Matrix

| Exchange | Minimum Contracts | Maximum Contracts | Typical Data Points (30 days) | Data Completeness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Binance | 90 (8h contracts) | 720 (1h contracts) | 90-180 (majority) | High (>95%) |
| KuCoin | 90 (8h contracts) | 720 (1h contracts) | 90-180 (majority) | High (>95%) |
| Hyperliquid | 720 (all) | 720 (all) | 720 (uniform) | Medium (85-95%) |
| Backpack | 720 (all) | 720 (all) | 720 (uniform) | Variable (70-95%) |

## Data Quality Management Framework

### Historical Data Window Configuration

The system utilizes a configurable historical window (default 30 days) defined in `config/settings.py`:

```
HISTORICAL_WINDOW_DAYS = 30  # Configurable parameter
HISTORICAL_SYNC_ENABLED = True  # Synchronized windows across exchanges
HISTORICAL_ALIGN_TO_MIDNIGHT = True  # Clean UTC boundaries

```

### Data Sufficiency Tiers

Given the varying data availability across exchanges and contracts, the system implements adaptive confidence levels:

| Data Points Available | Confidence Level | Statistical Validity | Display Treatment | Calculation Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0-9 | None | Insufficient | No Z-score shown | Skip calculation |
| 10-29 | Low | Limited reliability | Z-score with warning (⚠️) | Calculate with caveat |
| 30-89 | Medium | Acceptable for 8h/4h | Standard display | Normal calculation |
| 90-179 | High | Good for 4h contracts | Standard display | Full confidence |
| 180+ | Very High | Excellent statistical base | Standard display | Optimal confidence |

### Data Completeness Assessment

The system evaluates data quality based on expected vs. actual data points:

| Completeness Ratio | Quality Rating | Z-Score Reliability | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 95-100% | Excellent | Full reliability | Calculate normally |
| 85-94% | Good | High reliability | Calculate with metadata note |
| 70-84% | Fair | Moderate reliability | Calculate with visible warning |
| 50-69% | Poor | Low reliability | Calculate with strong warning |
| <50% | Insufficient | Unreliable | Do not calculate |

**Completeness Calculation:**

```
Completeness = (Actual Data Points / Expected Data Points) × 100%
Where: Expected Data Points = (Window Days × 24) / Funding Interval Hours

```

### Handling Market Anomalies

The system preserves all raw data without filtering to maintain market integrity:

| Anomaly Type | Example | Treatment | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exchange Caps | Binance ±0.75% limit | Include in calculations | Represents actual market conditions |
| Extreme Spikes | 10x normal rate | Include in calculations | May indicate important market events |
| Data Gaps | API outages | Exclude nulls, adjust completeness | Avoid interpolation bias |
| New Listings | <30 days of data | Use available data with low confidence | Progressive confidence building |
| Delisted Contracts | Discontinued pairs | Maintain historical data | Preserve statistical record |

## Statistical Calculation Methodology

### Calculation Pipeline

The Z-score calculation follows a structured pipeline for each contract:

1. **Data Retrieval Phase**
    - Query `funding_rates_historical` table for contract-specific data
    - Apply configured window (default 30 days)
    - Order by funding_time descending
2. **Data Validation Phase**
    - Count actual data points received
    - Calculate expected data points based on funding interval
    - Determine completeness percentage
    - Assign confidence level
3. **Statistical Computation Phase**
    - Remove null values without interpolation
    - Calculate mean of clean dataset
    - Calculate standard deviation
    - Compute Z-score for funding rate if sufficient data exists
    - Compute Z-score for APR if sufficient data exists
4. **Percentile Ranking Phase**
    - Determine position in historical distribution for funding rate
    - Calculate percentile rank (0-100) for funding rate
    - Determine position in historical distribution for APR
    - Calculate percentile rank (0-100) for APR

### Percentile Ranking Methodology

The system calculates percentile rankings to show where current values fall within the historical distribution:

| Percentile Range | Statistical Interpretation | Expected Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-10th | Bottom 10% of historical values | 10% of observations |
| 10-25th | Lower quartile range | 15% of observations |
| 25-50th | Below median | 25% of observations |
| 50-75th | Above median | 25% of observations |
| 75-90th | Upper quartile range | 15% of observations |
| 90-99th | Top 10% of historical values | 9% of observations |
| 99-100th | Top 1% of historical values | 1% of observations |

**Percentile Advantages:**

- Provides intuitive understanding of relative position
- Adapts to each asset's unique distribution
- Self-adjusts during regime changes
- Distribution-independent interpretation

### Cross-Exchange Statistical Independence

Each exchange-contract pair maintains independent statistics to preserve market microstructure:

| Statistical Measure | Calculation Scope | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mean | Per exchange-contract | Each market has unique equilibrium |
| Standard Deviation | Per exchange-contract | Volatility varies by liquidity |
| Z-Score | Per exchange-contract | Relative to own history |
| Percentile | Per exchange-contract | Distribution-specific |
| Statistical Measure | Per exchange-contract | Contract-specific |

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Computational Requirements

With 1,240 active contracts updating every 30 seconds, the system must efficiently process:

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total Contracts | 1,240 | Sum across all exchanges |
| Update Frequency | 30 seconds | System-wide refresh rate |
| Calculations per Update | 1,240 | One per contract |
| Monthly Calculations | 3,571,200 | 1,240 × 2 × 60 × 24 × 30 |
| Annual Calculations | 43,094,400 | 1,240 × 2 × 60 × 24 × 365 |

### Database Optimization Strategies

1. **Materialized Views for Statistics**
    
    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW funding_statistics_mv AS
    SELECT
        exchange,
        symbol,
        AVG(funding_rate) as mean_30d,
        STDDEV(funding_rate) as std_30d,
        COUNT(*) as data_points,
        MIN(funding_time) as oldest_data,
        MAX(funding_time) as newest_data
    FROM funding_rates_historical
    WHERE funding_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY exchange, symbol;
    
    -- Refresh strategy
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY funding_statistics_mv;
    
    ```
    
2. **Optimized Indexing Strategy**
    
    ```sql
    -- Composite index for time-series queries
    CREATE INDEX idx_historical_composite
    ON funding_rates_historical(exchange, symbol, funding_time DESC);
    
    -- Covering index for statistics
    CREATE INDEX idx_historical_stats
    ON funding_rates_historical(exchange, symbol, funding_rate, funding_time)
    WHERE funding_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
    
    ```
    
3. **Batch Processing Architecture**
    - Single query retrieves all statistics
    - Parallel processing per exchange
    - Memory caching between update cycles
    - Asynchronous calculation to avoid blocking

## Contract-Centric UI Architecture

### Primary Display: Flat Contract List

The system displays all 1,240 individual contracts in a flat, sortable list with Z-scores as the PRIMARY statistical measure column.

### Display Structure

- **Format**: Single flat list of ALL contracts (no asset grouping)
- **Primary Sort**: |Z-score| descending (extremes first)
- **Row Count**: 1,240 individual contracts
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Required (react-window with VariableSizeList)
- **Component**: New `ContractZScoreGrid.tsx` (not modifying existing AssetFundingGrid)

### Dynamic Row Height System

| Z-Score Range | Row Treatment | Height | Information Displayed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |Z| < 2.0 | Standard row | 40px | Contract, Exchange, Z-score, Funding, APR |
| |Z| ≥ 2.0 | Expanded row | 120px | All above PLUS: Percentile (99.9th), 30d μ/σ, Confidence, Data points, Next funding |

### Neutral Heat Map Color Scheme

| Z-Score Range | Color | Hex Code | Visual Weight | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < -2.5 | Deep Blue | #3B82F6 | Heavy | Extreme cold (statistical) |
| -2.5 to -1.5 | Light Blue | #60A5FA | Medium | Cold |
| -1.5 to -0.5 | Very Light Blue | #93C5FD | Light | Cool |
| -0.5 to 0.5 | Gray/Neutral | #F3F4F6 | Minimal | Normal |
| 0.5 to 1.5 | Light Orange | #FED7AA | Light | Warm |
| 1.5 to 2.5 | Orange | #FB923C | Medium | Hot |
| > 2.5 | Deep Orange | #EA580C | Heavy | Extreme hot (statistical) |

**Note**: Using a neutral blue-orange color scheme for statistical visualization.

### Update Zone Management

To handle 1,240 contracts efficiently, the system implements two update zones:

### Zone Definitions

1. **Active Zone** (Top 100 by |Z-score|)
    - Most statistically significant contracts
    - 30-second update cycle
    - Smooth value transitions
    - Auto-updates as Z-scores change
2. **Stable Zone** (Remaining ~1,140 contracts)
    - Lower statistical deviation contracts
    - 2-minute batch updates
    - Reduces computational load by 75%
    - Updates in background

### Performance Impact

- Reduces active updates from 1,240 to ~100 contracts per cycle
- Maintains responsiveness for statistical extremes
- Allows smooth 60fps scrolling through all data
- Memory efficient with virtual scrolling

### Statistical Detail Panel

Clicking on any contract opens a detailed statistical view showing comprehensive data for that specific contract:

## Filtering System

### Simple Filtering Implementation

### Client-Side Filters

- **Technology**: React state management
- **Purpose**: Statistical data exploration
- **Structure**:

```tsx
interface FilterOptions {
  minAbsZScore: number;      // Filter by minimum |Z-score|
  exchanges: string[];        // Filter by exchange
  searchTerm: string;         // Search contracts
}
```

### Features

- Filter by minimum |Z-score| value
- Filter by exchange
- Search contracts by name
- Sort by various statistical measures

### Advanced Filtering Architecture

### Filter State Management

```tsx
interface FilterState {
  // Display filters
  showExtremesOnly: boolean;   // |Z| > 2.0

  // Numeric filters
  minAbsZScore: number;         // 0-4 range slider
  minVolume?: number;           // Optional volume filter

  // Categorical filters
  exchanges: string[];          // Multi-select
  fundingIntervals: number[];   // [1, 4, 8] hours

  // Search
  searchTerm: string;           // Contract/asset search
  searchMode: 'contract' | 'asset' | 'both';

  // Sorting
  sortBy: 'zscore_abs' | 'zscore' | 'funding' | 'apr' | 'contract';
  sortDirection: 'asc' | 'desc';
}

```

### Display Filtering Logic

- Apply filters to statistical data
- Sort by selected statistical measure
- Time-based refresh settings
- Exchange-specific display preferences

## Performance Optimization for UI

### Virtual Scrolling Implementation

### Technology Stack

```bash
npm install react-window react-window-infinite-loader

```

### Implementation Details

```tsx
import { VariableSizeList as List } from 'react-window';
import AutoSizer from 'react-virtualized-auto-sizer';

// Dynamic height calculation for rows
const getItemSize = (index: number): number => {
  const contract = contracts[index];
  return Math.abs(contract.zScore) >= 2.0 ? 120 : 40;
};

// Memoized row component
const Row = memo(({ index, style, data }) => {
  const contract = data[index];
  const isExtreme = Math.abs(contract.zScore) >= 2.0;

  return (
    <div style={style} className={getRowClassName(contract.zScore)}>
      {isExtreme ? <ExpandedRow {...contract} /> : <StandardRow {...contract} />}
    </div>
  );
});

```

| Overscan count | 5 | Smooth scrolling buffer |
| Total DOM nodes | ~40 | Not 1,240 - huge performance gain |
| Scroll FPS target | 60 | Smooth user experience |
| Row recycling | Aggressive | Reuse DOM nodes |

### Memory Management Strategy

| Component | Initial Load | Lazy Load | Memory Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contract data (1,240) | Yes | - | ~50MB |
| Z-score calculations | Yes | - | ~10MB |
| Historical data | No | On demand | Saves ~200MB |
| Charts | No | On click | Saves ~100MB |
| Cross-exchange data | No | On modal open | Saves ~50MB |
| **Total on load** | - | - | **~60MB** |

### Update Performance Optimization

### Batch Update Strategy

```tsx
// Batch updates to prevent excessive re-renders
const batchedUpdates = useMemo(() => {
  return debounce((updates: ContractUpdate[]) => {
    // Group by update zone
    const zoneUpdates = groupBy(updates, 'updateZone');

    // Apply updates in priority order
    applyPinnedUpdates(zoneUpdates.pinned);      // Immediate
    applyActiveUpdates(zoneUpdates.active);      // 30 seconds
    queueStableUpdates(zoneUpdates.stable);      // 2 minutes
  }, 100);
}, []);

```

    - Database schema with per-contract statistics
    - Z-score calculation for all 1,240 contracts
    - New flat list API endpoint (`/api/contracts-with-zscores`)
    - Virtual scrolling UI with react-window
    - Dynamic row height (40px standard, 120px for extremes)
    - Blue-orange heat map visualization
    - Basic sorting by |Z-score|
    - 30-second update cycle
2. **Enhanced Interactivity** (Days 11-15)
    - Update zones for performance (active/stable)
    - Cross-exchange comparison modal
    - Advanced filtering (exchange, interval, volume)
    - Advanced statistical filters
3. **Polish and Optimization** (Days 16-20)
    - Performance tuning for 1,240 contracts
    - Statistical summary display
    - Historical Z-score patterns
    - Advanced visualizations
    - CSV export functionality
    - User preference management

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Data Quality Management**: Robust handling of incomplete/missing data
2. **Performance Optimization**: Sub-second processing for all contracts
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive visualization without information overload
4. **System Reliability**: Graceful degradation when data is insufficient
5. **Statistical Validity**: Appropriate use of percentiles for ranking

### Technical Prerequisites

### Backend Requirements

- PostgreSQL 12+ (for advanced window functions and materialized views)
- Python 3.8+ with NumPy, Pandas, SciPy for calculations
- FastAPI with async support for 1,240 contracts
- Adequate server resources (minimum 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores)
- Existing historical data (minimum 7 days, optimal 30+ days)

### Frontend Requirements

- React 18+ for modern hooks and performance
- **react-window** for virtual scrolling (REQUIRED for 1,240 rows)
- TypeScript for type safety with large datasets
- Recharts or lightweight charting library
- localStorage API for filter preferences

## Critical Implementation Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This specification reflects comprehensive UI/UX design decisions:

### Fundamental Architecture Changes

1. **Display Format**: 1,240 individual contracts in a FLAT LIST (not grouped by asset)
    - No asset grouping or hierarchy
    - Each contract is a separate row
    - Direct access to all contracts
2. **Primary Statistic**: Z-score is the MAIN column, always visible
    - Not a secondary indicator
    - Primary sort is by |Z-score| descending
    - Funding rates are supporting information
3. **Color Scheme**: Blue-Orange heat map (NOT green-red)
    - Blue for negative Z-scores (cold)
    - Orange for positive Z-scores (hot)
    - Provides neutral statistical visualization
4. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling is REQUIRED (not optional)
    - Cannot render 1,240 DOM nodes
    - Must use react-window or similar
    - Target 60fps scrolling
5. **Dynamic Rows**: Extreme Z-scores (|Z| > 2.0) get expanded rows
    - Standard rows: 40px height
    - Expanded rows: 120px height
    - ~250 contracts will be expanded at any time
6. **Update Zones**: Two-tier system for performance
    - Active: 30-second updates (top 100 by |Z|)
    - Stable: 2-minute updates (remaining ~1,140)
7. **MVP Focus**: Core Statistical Monitor first, advanced features later
    - Get basic Z-score display working
    - Defer historical charts and complex features
    - Validate performance before adding complexity

These decisions are FINAL and should be implemented exactly as specified.

This comprehensive specification provides the detailed technical foundation for implementing Z-score statistical analysis within your funding rate system, accurately reflecting both the statistical requirements and the specific UI/UX design decisions for the production environment.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Z-Score Implementation Compliance Pre-commit Hook
# Ensures implementation matches Z_score.md specification

echo "Running Z-Score compliance validation..."

# Run Python validation script
python scripts/validate_zscore_implementation.py
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then

# Daily Z-Score Implementation Validation
# Run this script daily to ensure ongoing compliance

echo "==================================="
echo "DAILY Z-SCORE COMPLIANCE CHECK"
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo "==================================="

# 1. Run automated validation
python scripts/validate_zscore_implementation.py

# 2. Check implementation tracking document
echo "\nChecking implementation progress..."
python -c "
import re
with open('docs/zscore_implementation_tracking.md', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    completed = len(re.findall(r'\[x\]', content, re.I))
    total = len(re.findall(r'\[.\]', content))
    print(f'Progress: {completed}/{total} tasks completed ({100*completed/total:.1f}%)')
"

# 3. Verify critical files exist
echo "\nVerifying critical files..."
files=(
    "utils/zscore_calculator.py"
    "dashboard/src/components/Grid/ContractZScoreGrid.tsx"
    "tests/test_zscore_compliance.py"
)

for file in "${files[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "  ✅ $file exists"
    else
        echo "  ❌ $file missing"
    fi
done

# 4. Check for deviations
echo "\nChecking for common deviations..."
# Check for red/green colors
if grep -r "color.*red\|color.*green\|#FF0000\|#00FF00" dashboard/src --include="*.tsx" --include="*.css"; then
    echo "  ⚠️  WARNING: Red/green colors detected (should be blue/orange)"
fi

# Check for asset grouping
if grep -r "AssetGroup\|asset.*group\|group.*by.*asset" dashboard/src/components/Grid/ContractZScoreGrid.tsx; then
    echo "  ⚠️  WARNING: Asset grouping detected (should be flat list)"
fi

echo "\n==================================="
echo "Validation complete. Check output above for issues."
```

### 5. Quick Reference Guide

#### 5.1 Critical Line Numbers
**Keep these references handy during development:**

| Requirement | Specification Lines | Priority |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **FLAT LIST (No Grouping)** | 478, 482, 1088-1091 | CRITICAL |
| **Virtual Scrolling** | 485, 674-694, 1077, 1100-1103 | CRITICAL |
| **Blue-Orange Colors** | 497-506, 1096-1099 | CRITICAL |
| **Dynamic Row Heights** | 492-493, 1104-1107 | CRITICAL |
| **|Z-score| Primary Sort** | 483, 1094-1095 | CRITICAL |
| **1,240 Contracts** | 268, 484 | CRITICAL |
| Database Schema | 835-902 | HIGH |
| API Response Structure | 359-387 | HIGH |
| Confidence Levels | 159-165 | HIGH |
| Performance Targets | 319-324, 945-951, 1001-1007 | HIGH |
| Update Zones | 515-529, 1108-1111 | MEDIUM |

#### 5.2 Component File Mapping

| Component | File Location | Spec Lines |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Z-Score Calculator | `utils/zscore_calculator.py` | 14, 201-227 |
| Contract Grid | `dashboard/src/components/Grid/ContractZScoreGrid.tsx` | 486 |
| API Endpoint | `api.py` → `/api/contracts-with-zscores` | 345-387 |
| Database Table | `funding_statistics` | 835-880 |
| Compliance Tests | `tests/test_zscore_compliance.py` | N/A |

### 6. Deviation Detection and Prevention

#### 6.1 Warning Signs of Deviation

**🚨 STOP if you find yourself:**
1. **Grouping contracts by asset** → Should be FLAT list (line 1088)
2. **Using red/green colors** → Should be blue/orange (line 1096)
3. **Not using virtual scrolling** → REQUIRED for performance (line 1100)
4. **Modifying AssetFundingGrid** → Create NEW ContractZScoreGrid (line 486)
5. **Using fixed Z-score cutoffs** → Use percentiles for ranking (lines 230-239)
6. **Rendering all 1,240 DOM nodes** → Must virtualize (line 703)
7. **Sorting by funding rate first** → |Z-score| is primary (line 1094)

#### 6.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correct Approach | Spec Reference |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Asset hierarchy | Flat contract list | Lines 478, 1088 |
| Red/green for positive/negative | Blue/orange heat map | Lines 497-506 |
| Standard HTML table | Virtual scrolling with react-window | Line 485, 1077 |
| Same height for all rows | Dynamic: 40px or 120px | Lines 492-493 |
| Interpolating missing data | Exclude nulls, adjust completeness | Line 195 |
| Global statistics | Per exchange-contract statistics | Lines 250-258 |
| Fixed Z-score cutoffs | Percentile-based rankings | Lines 230-239 |

### 7. Compliance Enforcement Tools

#### 7.1 VS Code Settings
Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

    "activityBar.background": "#3B82F6",
    "statusBar.background": "#FB923C"
  }
}
```

#### 7.2 NPM Scripts for Validation
Add to `dashboard/package.json`:

```json
