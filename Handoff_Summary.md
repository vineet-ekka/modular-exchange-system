# Modular Exchange System - Handoff Summary

## Project Overview
A modular system for fetching and processing cryptocurrency perpetual futures data from multiple exchanges (Backpack, Binance, KuCoin, Deribit). The system normalizes data into a unified format with APR calculations and can export to CSV and upload to Supabase database.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: When using historical collection, ALWAYS specify `--duration` parameter to avoid indefinite runs. Example: `python main_historical.py --duration 3600` for 1 hour.

## Current State (As of 2025-07-25 - UPDATED)

### Working Features
1. **Multi-Exchange Support**
   - Binance (USD-M and COIN-M futures)
   - KuCoin (Futures)
   - Backpack (PERP)
   - Deribit (Perpetual contracts)
   - Kraken (Futures - with special funding rate handling)

2. **Real-Time Data Collection**
   - Funding rates with APR calculation (annualized funding rates)
   - Mark/Index prices
   - Open interest (high-performance async fetching)
   - Contract metadata
   - Health monitoring with reliability scores
   - **NEW: Loop mode for continuous updates** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

3. **Historical Data Collection** ✅ NEW & FIXED
   - Continuous fetching at configurable intervals
   - Time-series storage with timestamps
   - **CSV export to cumulative file** (NEW 2025-07-24)
   - Smart rate limiting per exchange
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Progress reporting and statistics
   - **Duration parameter now works correctly** (fixed 2025-07-22)

4. **Loop Mode for main.py** ✅ NEW (2025-07-22)
   - `--loop` flag for continuous real-time updates
   - Configurable intervals (default: 300 seconds)
   - Duration limits to prevent indefinite runs
   - Quiet mode for production deployments
   - UPSERT operations for latest data only
   - 100% success rate in production testing

5. **Output Options**
   - Console display with APR
   - CSV export

- **Binance**: Separate USD-M and COIN-M markets with different API endpoints
- **KuCoin**: Uses millisecond timestamps for funding intervals
- **Deribit**: Fixed 8-hour funding intervals, open interest in contracts (converted to USD)
- **Backpack**: Simple REST API with straightforward data format

## MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS DELIVERED

### 1. **BUSINESS-FOCUSED VALIDATION SYSTEM** ⭐ COMPLETELY REDESIGNED ⭐
   - **BEFORE**: 400+ lines of academic validation checking data types, ranges, and patterns
   - **AFTER**: 100 lines of business-critical validation that actually matters
   - **Business Logic Focus**: Data freshness, exchange coverage, price sanity checks
   - **Quality Scoring**: 0-100 data quality score instead of walls of warnings

   - **Funding intervals**: Track how often funding occurs (4h, 8h, etc.)
   - **Trading intelligence**: Compare funding costs across exchanges
   - **Simplified display**: Removed next_funding_time for cleaner output
   - **100% coverage**: All contracts include funding rate and APR data

### 3. **Exchange Health Monitoring** ⭐ NEW ⭐

   - **Trading Intelligence**: Understand the yearly impact of funding costs/returns (e.g., 424.97% APR)
   - **Cross-Exchange Comparison**: Compare annualized rates across different exchanges and funding intervals
   - **Robust Calculation**: Handles null values and zero intervals gracefully
   - **Display Integration**: APR column included in console output and CSV exports

## VALIDATION SYSTEM REDESIGN

### What Was Removed (Academic Noise)
```python
# ELIMINATED: Pointless academic validation
- Range checking (funding rates -1% to 1%)
- Data type warnings for numeric columns
- Suspicious symbol length validation
- Mark/index price difference alerts (>10%)
- Missing data percentage warnings
- 200+ lines of irrelevant checks
```

### What Was Added (Business Intelligence)
```python
# NEW: Business-critical validation
- Data freshness checks (>10 minutes = warning, >30 = error)
- Exchange coverage validation (missing critical exchanges)
- Cross-exchange price sanity (BTC price spread >1% = suspicious)
- Duplicate detection (exchange-symbol pairs)
- Quality scoring (0-100 actionable score)
- Health monitoring (API success rates)
- Complete funding timing (next_funding_time with UTC timezone)
```

### Configuration Validation (`config/validator.py`)
```python
# Only validates settings that cause crashes:
DISPLAY_LIMIT = -50              # Error: "DISPLAY_LIMIT must be positive integer"
EXCHANGES = "not_a_dict"         # Error: "EXCHANGES must be a dictionary"
API_DELAY = -1                   # Error: "API_DELAY must be non-negative"
```
